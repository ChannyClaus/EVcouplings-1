# EVcouplings

Predict protein structure, function and mutations using evolutionary sequence covariation.

*Please note that this package is in an early stage and under active development. The API might change at any point without prior warning - use at your own risk :)*

## Installation and setup

### Installing the Python package

If you are simply interested in using EVcouplings as a codebase, installing the Python package is all you need to do. If you want to run sequence searches, infer model parameters from alignments, etc. also need to follow the sections about installing external tools and databases.

#### Requirements

EVcouplings requires a Python >= 3.5 installation. Since it depends on many packages from the scientific Python stack, we recommend using the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

#### Installation

To install the latest version of EVcouplings from the github repository, run

    pip install git+https://<your_github_user_name>@github.com/debbiemarkslab/EVcouplings.git
    
Installation from PyPI will be added at a later point.

#### Update

To update to the latest version after previously installing EVcouplings, run

    pip install -U --no-deps git+https://<your_github_user_name>@github.com/debbiemarkslab/EVcouplings.git



### External software tools

*After installation and before running jobs, the paths to the respective binaries have to be set in your EVcouplings job configuration file(s).*

#### plmc

Tool for inferring undirected statistical models from sequence variation. Download and install plmc to a directory of your choice from the [plmc github repository](https://github.com/debbiemarkslab/plmc) according to the included documentation.

For compatibility with EVcouplings, please compile using

    make all-openmp32


#### jackhmmer

Download and install HMMER from the [HMMER webpage](http://hmmer.org/download.html) to a directory of your choice.

#### HHsuite (optional)

EVcouplings uses the hhfilter tool to filter sequence alignments. Installation is only required if you need this functionality.

Download and install HHsuite from the [HHsuite github repository](https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite) to a directory of your choice.


### Databases

*After download and before running jobs, the paths to the respective databases have to be set in your EVcouplings job configuration file(s).*

#### Sequence databases

Download unzip at least one of the following sequence databases:
* [Uniref100](ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/uniref/uniref100/uniref100.fasta.gz)
* [Uniref90](ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/uniref/uniref90/uniref90.fasta.gz)

You can however use any sequence database of your choice. The database for any particular job will be set in the job configuration file.

#### Structure and mapping databases

PDB entries will be automatically fetched from the web in the new MMTF format. You can however also pre-download these files and place them in a directory if you want to (and set pdb_mmtf_dir in your job configuration).

Uniprot to PDB index mapping files will be automatically generated by EVcouplings based on the SIFTS database. Point the sifts_mapping_table and sifts_sequence_db configuration parameters to file paths in a valid directory, and if the files do not exist, they will be created.

## Usage and tutorials

Please refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the [notebooks subdirectory](https://github.com/debbiemarkslab/EVcouplings/tree/master/notebooks) on how to
* edit configuration files
* run jobs
* use EVcouplings as a Python library
